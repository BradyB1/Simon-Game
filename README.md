# Simon-Game
In this project, I created a version of the Simon game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (+jQuery). In this game the user follow the previous pattern in each iterating level. For example, if the first level flashes blue, you click blue. Then if the next level flashed green, you click green. It continues like this until you get the sequence wrong.
